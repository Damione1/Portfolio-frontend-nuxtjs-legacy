# portfolio-frontend

## Project
This site is my last personal project.
It's a portfolio site that I built to improve my skills on the latest technologies. It consists of two applications: a Nuxt.js application as a frontend framework and a Node.js application as a backend API.

The website is built using the following technologies:
- Nuxt.js
- Node.js
- JWT authentication
- MongoDB
- Google App Engine for hosting
- Google cloud storage for image storage
