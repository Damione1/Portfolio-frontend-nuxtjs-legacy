# My Portfolio Frontend with Nuxt.js 2 (Legacy)

This is the repository of the legacy version of my personal portfolio's frontend built with Nuxt.js 2. As an archive of my development journey, this project represents a period of growth and exploration in the Vue.js ecosystem.

Although this project served me well, it has not been updated or maintained for the past two years. Consequently, it doesn't take advantage of the latest web technologies and practices. In the spirit of progression and embracing new challenges, I decided to transition to a Next.js based frontend for my portfolio.

## Important Notice

Please note that this Nuxt.js 2 based project is no longer actively maintained and may contain outdated dependencies or practices. For the current version of my portfolio's frontend, refer to my new repository that uses Next.js [here](https://github.com/Damione1/portfolio-frontend-react).

## Backend Service

Although this Nuxt.js 2 frontend is legacy, the backend service is fully operational and continues to support the current version of the frontend built with Next.js. You can find the maintained backend repository [here](https://github.com/Damione1/portfolio-nodejs). It's crucial to connect to this backend to ensure full functionality and to showcase the capabilities of the portfolio project.

Should you wish to run the legacy frontend, ensure that it points to the correct backend URL so that you can experience the full end-to-end functionality as it was initially designed. The backend exposes necessary APIs for portfolio data, which remains a cornerstone of showcasing the dynamic aspects of the portfolio.

Keep in mind that while the backend remains active, the frontend in this repository is not the latest and lacks updates from the past two years. The backend is compatible with the new Next.js frontend.

## Legacy Project Setup

If for historical interest or archival purposes you'd like to set up the legacy frontend, follow these steps:

### Installation

Clone the outdated repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Damione1/portfolio-nuxtjs.git
cd portfolio-nuxtjs
```

Install the old dependencies (Note: Some packages might be deprecated or have high severity vulnerabilities):

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server with hot-reloading at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building and Starting Production Server

To create a production build and start a server to serve it:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Deploying

Though deploying this legacy project isnâ€™t recommended, you can follow the typical Nuxt.js deployment strategies if needed.

## Looking Forward

For a more current and regularly updated portfolio frontend, please direct your attention to the Next.js version of this project. The new frontend not only reflects the latest standards but also represents my commitment to maintaining a state-of-the-art showcase for my professional work in web development.

Thank you for your interest, and I hope the legacy project can still be of some educational value. For an optimal experience and to view my latest work, please visit the [Next.js based portfolio](https://github.com/Damione1/portfolio-frontend-react).
